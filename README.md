# A plain substitute for `console.log()`

## Why use this package?

**fu\*k-consolelog** provides you with a one-word simple method `print()`; so you don't need to type that `console` and then `.` afterward `log`, that's garbage and time-wasting. Use a plain one-word `print()` method after installing **fu\*k-consolelog**.
